| Calls to action serve as the primary visual content element (when applicable). |     o      |    o    |    o    |      o       |    o     |                                          |
| Negative space is used purposefully to help the user scan, identify grouped/related content and separate unrelated items. |     o      |    o    |    o    |      o       |    o     |                                          |

| Items with the most contrast are also the most important items on the screen, both to the user and/or the business. |     o      |    o    |    o    |      x       |    o     | **singapore AL** flight search should be clearer and easier to recognize (color contrast) |
